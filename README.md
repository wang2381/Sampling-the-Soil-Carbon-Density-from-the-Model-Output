# Sampling-the-Soil-Carbon-Density-from-the-Model-Output

The final project of STAT522 Sampling and Survey Techniques. In the project, I did the following,

1. Applied SRS, Stratification, and Two-Stage Cluster sampling on the 40000+ pixels of soil carbon density from the model output.

2. Compared the goodness of each sampling method with the population data.
